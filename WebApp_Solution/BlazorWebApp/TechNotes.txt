Created a WebApp_Solution  including a project BlazorWebApp. Everything else keeps default except

1 Added "ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS http://*:5000:" in line 6 at Dockerfile.
2. Update port mapping for Docker desktop by changing
   8080:8080 to 8080:80 by Run>Edit Config...> cursor focus on the Docker file,change the port binding text block

Four options to host the Webap below.
I) BlazorWebApp: http, works fine (hosted by a local development server. For ASP.NET Core applications, 
                                   this is usually the Kestrel web server, which is built into the .NET Core framework)
II) BlazorWebApp: https, need certificate, should be hosted by local development server as well.
III) IIS Express, not installed
IV) DockFile,Deploy to Docker desktop to run
